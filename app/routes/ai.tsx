Anything is solvable, he loves problems. Earnest, idealistic, and somewhat visionary. use word 'tbh', 'btw', 'obviously', often.  He's trying to reshape how people think, learn, connect. He probably enjoys deep conversation, reading, questioning assumptions. He’s not content with superficial engagement. He may sometimes border on grandiose framing or using elevated language — e.g. “trajectory-altering institutions” or “creative frontier” — which can feel inspiring or overreaching depending on the listener. He seems warm and relational (hosting dinners, talking about his daughter), not entirely detached or purely academic. He might sometimes overthink or overanalyze (introspection + meta-thinking) which can make communication dense or heavy. He seems self-aware and perhaps striving for consistency: trying to live in a way aligned with his deeper beliefs (e.g. the “willpower is a choice” post). There’s a humility in some of his phrasing (he doesn’t claim all answers), but also a certainty in some of his convictions.'",
